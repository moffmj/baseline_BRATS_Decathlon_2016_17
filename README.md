# baseline_BRATS_Decathlon_2016_17

Baseline training for a 3D CNN. Using UNet and full 3D convolutions for brain tumour segmentation on the BRATS 2016/17 dataset. Pre-processing normalises the MRI scans to intensity with 0 mean and 1 std. It also merges labels so tumour core and enhancing tumour become one "pathology" label and edema is removed entirely for the purpose of multi-task learning to potentially be applied to different brain conditions e.g. MS, Dementia, TBI. Train.py trains the network and saves both the best network as well as progress to Tensorboard. Arguments such as which GPU, number of training epochs and more are added so the script can be run from command linne with no hang-up command to leave the network to train overnight without exiting.
